Description: Easy-to-use encryption of R objects using modern cryptography.
    Objects are serialized and then encrypted using 'XChaCha20-Poly1305' (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChaCha20-Poly1305>)
    which follows RFC 8439 for authenticated encryption (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authenticated_encryption>).
    Cryptographic functions are provided by the 'monocypher' 'C' library (<https://monocypher.org>).

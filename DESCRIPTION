Description: Encrypt R objects to a raw vector or file using modern cryptographic
    techniques.  Password-based key derivation is with 'Argon2' (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon2>).
    Objects are serialized and then encrypted using 'XChaCha20-Poly1305' (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChaCha20-Poly1305>)
    which follows RFC 8439 for authenticated encryption (<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authenticated_encryption>).
    Cryptographic functions are provided by the included 'monocypher' 'C' library (<https://monocypher.org>).
